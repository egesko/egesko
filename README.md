# Welcome

Hi!  Welcome to my profile. I'm **Ege Demir**. I am currently a senior student in **Iowa State University**. I'm hoping to share my work with the github community, and collaborate with peers using the magic of open source license to develop libraries, products etc. to help as many people as I can.
